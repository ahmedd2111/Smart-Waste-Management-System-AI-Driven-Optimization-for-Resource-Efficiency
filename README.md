roject Overview

The Smart Waste Management System (SWMS) is a comprehensive, technology-driven solution aimed at improving urban waste collection processes. It integrates sensors, artificial intelligence, and real-time data analysis to enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and support environmental sustainability.

Key Features

Automated Waste Collection: Smart bins monitor fill levels and notify collection staff when they need to be emptied.

AI-Driven Sorting: Enhances recycling rates by automatically classifying waste.

Optimized Collection Routes: AI-powered dynamic routing reduces fuel consumption and collection times.

Overflow Prevention Alerts: Real-time monitoring prevents bins from overflowing.

Public Engagement: A mobile app allows residents to report issues and track bin status.

Energy-Efficient Operations: Solar panels power bins for sustainable energy use.

Predictive Maintenance: System detects potential issues and schedules maintenance before failures occur.

Smart City Integration: Data sharing with urban planning systems improves city-wide waste management.

Design Alternatives Considered

The team evaluated four design alternatives, each focusing on different objectives:

Cost-Effective System: Basic sensors, manual scheduling, and fixed routes.

AI-Optimized System: Advanced AI for waste sorting, real-time routing, and overflow predictions.

Sustainability-Focused System: Solar-powered bins, robotic sorting arms, and public engagement through a mobile app.

Smart City Integrated System: AI waste detection with cameras, real-time urban data integration, and traffic-aware collection scheduling.
